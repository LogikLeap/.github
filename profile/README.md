# 🚀 LogikLeap

**LogikLeap** is your high-performance, logic-driven decision engine built for developers, ops teams, and product builders who want smarter workflows, faster responses, and cleaner architecture.

> Think Zapier meets rule-based AI — but lean, blazing fast, and developer-first.

---

###  Why LogikLeap?

-  **Logic-First Workflows**  
  Design workflows with conditional logic, nested rules, and real-time triggers — no over-engineered pipelines.

-  **Fast, Lightweight, Serverless-Friendly**  
  Minimal dependencies. Deploy anywhere: edge, container, or lambda-style.

-  **Pluggable & Composable**  
  Bring your own integrations. Compose logic modules like functions — with type safety and observability.

- **Secure by Default**  
  Every rule and decision path is auditable, replayable, and traceable. Built with zero-trust logic in mind.

---

###  Core Features

-  Declarative rule engine (YAML, JSON, or code-native)
-  Modular plugin architecture
-  Trigger-based flow execution (webhook, API, event bus, etc.)
-  Built-in decision logs & replay debugger
-  SDKs for JavaScript, Python, and Go (more coming)
-  Role-based execution context + secret injection

---

###  Installation

```bash
npm install logikleap
# or
pip install logikleap
# or
go get github.com/logikleap/sdk```

##  Quick Start

```javascript 
import { Engine } from 'logikleap';

const engine = new Engine({
  rules: [
    { if: 'input.temperature > 75', then: 'turn_on_fan' },
    { if: 'input.temperature < 65', then: 'turn_on_heater' },
  ],
});

const result = engine.run({ temperature: 80 });
// result: { action: 'turn_on_fan' }
```


### Use Cases
•  Smart automation workflows
•  Policy-as-code enforcement
•  Feature flag evaluation
•  Financial rules/approvals
•  Edge-triggered logic routing


###  Dev Experience
•  Fully unit-testable
•  Event and rule tracing
•  Type-safe rule definitions (TS, JSONSchema)
•  CLI tooling for testing + debugging
